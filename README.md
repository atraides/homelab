<!-- -->
> **"What is a self-hosted service?"**
> The concept in which you host your own applications, data, and more. Taking away the "unknown" factor in how your data is > managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently.
