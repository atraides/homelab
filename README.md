This project was created to automate provisioning, operating and updating self-hosted services in the SAPstar Network Homelab utilizing [Infrastructure as Code][wiki-iac] and [GitOps][wiki-gitops].

> **"What is a homelab?"**
> Homelab is a laboratory at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies, practice for certifications, and so on.
> For more information about homelab in general, see the [r/homelab introduction][wiki-homelab].

<!-- -->
> **"What is a self-hosted service?"**
> The concept in which you host your own applications, data, and more. Taking away the "unknown" factor in how your data is > managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently.
> For more information about self-hosting in general, see the [r/self-hosting introduction][wiki-selfhosting].
