# Semantic Release

??? Info "What is Semantic Release"
    Semantic Release automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the package. More information about semantic-release available on their [site][website-semantic-release].

## Install Node.js

Semantic Release use Node.js, so first we have to install Node.js. Follow the relevant guide for your operating system on the Node.js [website][website-nodejs].

## Install Semantic Release

The recommended way to install Semantic Release is to use a local installation and add Semantic Release to the development dependencies. We can achieve this with the following command:

``` shell
npm install --save-dev semantic-release
```

With Semantic Release installed we have to add a couple plugins to handle certain activities like, updating the **CHANGELOG.md** and to **push to our repository**.

We are going to install the following recommended plugins:

- [semantic-release/changelog][plugin-semantic-changelog] to update a CHANGELOG file
- [semantic-release/git][plugin-semantic-git] to commit release assets to the project's git repository
- [conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits][plugin-conventional-commits] to implement the specification described at [conventionalcommits.org][website-conventional-commits]

To make commits easier we can also install cz-cli, which provides an easy-to-use interface for creating valid conventional commits.

- [cz-cli][plugin-cz-cli] to manage our commit messages

!!! Tip
    To avoid committing the entire `node_modules` directory use [gitignore.io][webpage-gitignore] and add node relevant ignores to our `.gitignore` file. This will include all the Node.js relevant files and directories which should not be committed to Git.

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/node >> .gitignore
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

``` shell
npm install --save-dev semantic-release/changelog
npm install --save-dev semantic-release/git
npm install --save-dev conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
npm install --save-dev commitizen
```

## Configure CI Pipeline

### GitHub

**Semantic Release** requires push access to the project Git repository in order to create [Git tags][how-to-gittabs] and update the **CHANGELOG.md**. Currently, only personal access tokens are supported on [GitHub][website-github]

#### Create a personal access token

Open your [GitHub profile][website-github-profiles] and request a new classic token for Semantic Release with **repo** rights.

![Access for Semantic Release](/assets/images/SemRel-Token-Access.png)

Next we have to add this token as a secret to our repository, so we can use it in our CI pipeline. Go to your repository configuration. Select **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions** and choose **New Repository secret**. Pick a secret name and upload the generated token.

In this guide we are using `RELEASE_TOKEN` for this purpose.

![Alt text](/assets/images/Repository-Secrets.png)

!!! Note
    Other plugins might need more secrets to work properly, for example release plugins which push images to docker, PyPI or other repositories. See each plugin's documentation for the environment variables required.

!!! Failure
    Semantic Release will **fail** with this workflow if the target branch is **protected** against pushes. If your target branch is protected follow the steps on this **[page](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/recipes/ci-configurations/github-actions.md#pushing-packagejson-changes-to-a-master-branch)**.

#### Set up a Workflow

GitHub uses `yaml` files in the `.github/workflows` directory to define our workflows for GitHub Actions. The following is a minimal configuration for semantic-release with a build running on the latest LTS version of Node when a new commit is pushed to a `master` or `main` branch. See [Semantic Release documentation][howto-semrel-github-workflow] for additional configuration options.

``` yaml title=".github/workflows/release.yml" hl_lines="25"
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          persist-credentials: false
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "lts/*"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_TOKEN }}
        run: npx semantic-release
```

#### Lock the Node.js packages

To make sure we install the same version of Node.js packages what we have locally to the CI environment we have to lock package version.

``` shell
npm install --package-lock-only
```

### Configure cz-cli

The **cz-cli** expecting a Commitizen-friendly repository. We can make our repository Commitizen-friendly by running the following command.

``` shell
npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
```

### Running Commitizen on `git commit`

With the default setup to use Commitizen we have call `git cz` or `cz`. To incorporate Commitizen into our regular git workflow we have to use a git hook. This is useful o ensure the proper commit format is enforced on contributions from those unfamiliar with Commitizen.

#### Traditional git hooks

Update `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg` with the following code:

``` bash title=".git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg"
#!/bin/bash
exec < /dev/tty && node_modules/.bin/cz --hook || true
```

``` shell
chmod +x .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
```

??? Question "Why exec < /dev/tty?"
    By default, git hooks are not interactive. This command allows the user to use their terminal to interact with Commitizen during the hook.
